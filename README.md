Instructions for Gobi / Girija:

1. uncommment "gobi version" lines of code in each file
2. comment out the corresponding version used by anisha
3. run each scraper to produce each csv
4. use rocketreach to reach out to relevant contacts at the hiring companies with custom links of candidates 

Note for future: As Girija starts running the script over the next few months the websites are bound to change a little bit here and there so we may need to periodically keep the scripts up to date with the site -- when we do that we can always think of ways to make our scripts more and more robust to site changes if it's worth it and needed at any given point in time.
