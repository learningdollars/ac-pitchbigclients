Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:
Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login
Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)
Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display
What we want from you: (aka: skills)
We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience. 
However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.
Relationship Details:
We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.
We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week. 
It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project."
