Art+Logic is looking for Full Stack Web Developers to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We’ve been around since 1991, and we’re still going strong. 
Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.
Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.
We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.
Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.
Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:

Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login
Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)
Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display

What we want from you: (aka: skills)
We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience. 
However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.
Relationship Details:
We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.
We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week. 
It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.  "

What is G2i?
G2i is a hiring platform for engineers ran by engineers. We are an international collective of industry leaders, conference speakers, and subject matter experts within React, React Native and Node that are passionate about working remotely and doing good in the world.
We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients. Say goodbye to hunting business, drawing up contracts, and working on dying tech. With one production focused, to the point code challenge (no whiteboarding or algorithms + on your own time) vetted by our engineering team, you'll have the opportunity to receive curated contract opportunities as well as become a part of an international collective of React experts. If that sounds up your alley or you would like to find out more, please feel free to reach out to dylan@g2i.co. 
G2i is short for ""Good News to the Internet."" We are convinced that our primary vision & mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision & mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home, parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.
Your background
In simple terms we want to hire an engineer that is excited about building applications in React Native, is comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and has strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:

You have 1+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of React Native and/or React production experience.
You are willing to complete a code challenge that often takes 6-8 hours to complete (there are no due dates or timers however).
You live in North America or South America.
You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.
You are available 30-40 hours per week.
You might have full-stack experience with either Rails, Node.js, Apollo Client/GraphQL, native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don't, that's OK too!
You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests.
You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.

Vetting - Developers and Clients
We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients who place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.
When we vet clients we make sure they:

Prioritize communication
Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines
Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it

When we vet engineers we make sure:

Engineers vet other engineers
Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding
Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored
Our process is completely transparent

Who you will work with
We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with Y Combinator funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.
Diversity
G2i is an equal opportunity employer. We’re dedicated to building a team where diversity in both ideas and identities is not only welcomed, but encouraged. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.
