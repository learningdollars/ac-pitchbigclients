Our name is easy. Just say “A.” The [A] brackets represent markup, microdata, content intelligence. The letter “[A]” represents the start, initiation, beginning of change. We are going to help change the world with intelligent content.
Learn more about [A] at simplea.com.
If this sounds like you, then write up a cover letter letting [A] know why you want to work at [A], what you do best, and what inspires you. A great cover letter will say much more than the resume (though we'd like to see that too).

Knowledge4All portal is a bilingual digital hub dedicated to all researchers, professionals, students, stakeholders, and the public. It offers easy access to the different knowledge products achieved within the Arab Knowledge Project (AKP) and to various data and publications on knowledge-related topics.
The importance of such hub stems from the central role of knowledge in the development of modern day societies, and from the deficiency in data and publications about the knowledge scene and its various components, mainly in the Arab region. We anticipate that the establishment of such a hub will facilitate and further promote research about knowledge in the Arab region and beyond, thus contributing to the sustainable development.
The Arab Knowledge Project (AKP) at UNDP is looking to recruit a “Web Developer” to update the Knowledge4All portal and upscale its data visualization tool, as well as perform maintenance and secure hosting services for the said products.

What you’ll be doing

You'll be deeply embedded with our teams of talented UX consultants and designers and other developers with one intention: building absolutely fantastic sites in Drupal 8, that are developed in a truly user centred way. You’ll also be building with future scalability in mind, writing clean, clever code and building modular assets that can be efficiently re-deployed.

What we need from you

We are looking for candidates on both a permanent or a freelance basis. For freelance, we could offer you work until at least September, on some very interesting premium site builds.

You'll be a self-starting back-end or full-stack Drupal developer. Expertise with the Drupal CMS is paramount, and a hunger to develop the best code imaginable, working collaboratively with other developers.

We could go on, but have a look round our offices, talk to us, and you’ll soon understand why it’s a great place to work.

Are you an experienced developer looking for a new challenge?

We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 70. We’re proud of the way we get great work done. Our clients love working with us and we partner with them on long-term projects. Our teams are engaged and excited about our work.

What do we offer?
Hard technical challenges (you won't find all the answers on Stack Overflow) where you can take ownership of the solution
Work as part of a talented, globally distributed, successful team
A productive and non-frustrating work environment from a focussed adherence to our agile/scrum processes (we really believe it helps getting good work done)
A great working atmosphere where you can share and learn with other smart people - on this and on other projects.
The best-in-class toolsets: Slack, CI/CD with Docker etc
Meetups in our Barcelona offices for our remote folks
Competitive rates
A long term working relationship: this project, then others.

 You'll be:

Working within a fast moving team (working ~11am - 8pm Central European time) of both backend and frontend engineers.
Building challenging business logic on top of open source Solidus.
Designing clean APIs and often interfacing with other legacy backend systems.
Solving hard business logic with elegant software design
Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code for scale
Ensuring the robustness, performance and failure characteristics of the system.
Writing well tested (rspec), defect free code with CI/CD
Taking ownership of production applications - managing issues, releases and ensuring quality

Good English verbal and written communication skills are essential. This is a contract position with a long term outlook (12 months+ full-time project) for the right candidate. We are looking for remote workers (most of the company is remote) or have openings based in our Barcelona office.

Why is it good to work with us?

We know that big ideas and big results only happen when you have the right people, working together smartly - whether that’s across the room or across the globe. We make the work fun and rewarding.

Because we work on cool projects. Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.

Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing. And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team. We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work). Want to know more?

We're looking for experienced Dev/Sec/Ops/SRE folk to join our team, helping our clients navigate and implement the Cloud-Native Vision™!
Passionate about K8s, Terraform, and all things Linux? Do you love applying cloud-native technologies to gracefully solve new problems? Enjoy creating systems that simplify application developers' lives? Do you enjoy wrangling AWS, GCP and Azure? (Azure... really??)
Then read on!

The Day to Day
As a consulting company, there's almost never such a thing as a normal day.
When on an engineering engagement, you could be wrangling Terraform configurations, tweaking Kubernetes clusters, crafting CI/CD pipelines, managing Cloud Foundry with BOSH, writing custom controllers in Go, or APIs in Python. Each client and each project is different, and that's what makes the job so enjoyable.
In-between engagements, and during our 20% time, we work on open source tooling, write about our experiences in our journal, or research the latest technologies for our workshops.
Requirements

The Right Role for You
We're actively searching for these roles. Feel free to mention the one that you think fits you best, or just tell us about yourself and we'll take it from there.
Kubernetes Expert who:
Has managed Kubernetes “in anger”
Is in love with and terrified by Istio
Has deployed EKS, Kops, GKE, AKS and knows the strengths and weaknesses of each
Has spliced into the control plane via webhooks, CRDs and custom controllers
Cloud Foundry & BOSH Operator who:
Has drunk the BOSH kool-aid
Believes in the developer experience of Cloud Foundry
Is absolutely in love with Concourse
Has Terraformed their twitter account
In addition to the specifics above, you should:

Be passionate about DevOps and Agile practices
Be deeply experienced in the UNIX/Linux world
Have worked in a pair programming environment
Have mentored others in a professional setting
Be excited about learning new technologies
…but have a healthy skepticism for the ""latest shiny""
We haven't mentioned education, and that's no accident. While we respect the perseverance and dedication it takes to get your higher degree, we also recognize that many smart and hard-working people opt to go straight into the industry. We don't judge anyone for either path.
Some of our work is with the US government, so we require US citizenship for some of our roles. Though we're 100% remote, time zones suck. We're only hiring people based in, or near, the US.
Benefits

Why You'll Love Working With Us
We strive to offer a structure that matches our values.
A Truly 100% Remote-First Company:
Not ""some remote employees,"" not ""many remote offices,"" but a truly 100% remote-first culture
It's not always easy, but being fully remote gives our people a healthier work/life balance, allows us to create a more diverse team, and helps us attract the best people we can find
A Deep Belief in Sustainable Pace:
We dedicate a day a week to internal projects, we never work more than 40 hours a week, and we give our people unlimited vacation (and 2 weeks of holidays)
People can't perform when they're overworked. Your brain needs time off to allow it to flourish when it's back on. DevOps is a marathon, not a sprint.
Benefits that You Can Count On:
To do good work, we have to feel we and our loved ones are safe. We provide that foundation for you.
We provide medical, dental & vision insurance, and retirement plans to all of our full time employees.
Our Values

While these values stem from moral roots, we also just believe they're the right way to run a business. Working in an environment of professionalism, respect, and emotional safety allows us to produce our best work and builds a culture that enriches everyone's lives.
Do What Works.
Our clients look to us to help them understand the myriad and constantly changing landscape of cloud-native tools. It's important to us that they succeed. This means focusing on the actual problems they face and leading them toward the simplest solutions possible. This is what we mean by ""Do What Works.""
Do The Right Thing.
We continually try to take the path that does right by our people and our clients, no matter how hard that can be. We believe that how you treat others inevitably comes back to you, so we try to keep our karma well-groomed.
Be Kind.
We're a business, not a brogrammer startup. We don't accept death marches, political backstabbing, or a ""take-it-for-the-team"" mentality. Instead, we believe in an environment of professionalism and respect.
As a bonus to those of us who read to the end: be sure to use the answer ""poppycock"" in the related question on your application.",https://www.learningdollars.com/client/select_engineers/?crid=2094
