I‚Äôm the founder of Delicious Brains Inc. We make high quality products for WordPress.The ‚Äúwe‚Äù is currently a small team of seven developers, one designer, one marketer, and myself. I‚Äôm very proud to say that our little crew has been managing to delight thousands of customers for years.Despite the crazy times we‚Äôre living in, we have big plans for 2020 and this is a great opportunity to join a small team of talented folks building awesome products before we get bigger. The JobI‚Äôm looking for a talented developer with lots of experience building WordPress plugins to join Jonesy in taking the WP Offload Media plugin to the next level. This involves building new features, fixing bugs, writing documentation, and supporting our customers via email.Although the job involves writing code a majority of the time, you will spend a significant amount of your time sending emails to our customers, helping them with their problems with WP Offload Media. You‚Äôll start by drafting replies and having Jonesy review them before sending, but in short order you will reply directly to customers.You‚Äôll also join the rest of our whole team in writing new articles and tutorials for our sites and updating existing content. We send an email to our 11k subscribers every week about our content.Although this is how you‚Äôll start, I‚Äôve shuffled people around lots in the past and we‚Äôll certainly be building new products in the future, so your role is certainly not set in stone. We have plans to start building a cloud component to WP Offload Media late this year or early next, so you will likely be involved with that project.

You respect old code, no matter how ugly it looks. You truly enjoy figuring out how old code works, refactoring it, and tackling the challenges that come with it. You have experience doing this type of work and know you love it. You‚Äôre a problem solver who loves to analyze an issue, recreate it and track it back to the source of the problem. You won‚Äôt commit any code unless it‚Äôs fully tested and solves the problem. Better still, you write the tests to go with it. You‚Äôre curious and love to learn. You embrace the opportunity to level up, learn something new and really dig into it. You‚Äôre a disciplined worker and have no trouble getting work done at home on any given day. You value consistency above preference and will adopt new coding styles, standards, and tools to that end. You are stellar at identifying the simple, elegant solution in a sea of over-engineering possibilities. Although you enjoy working with people to help you generate ideas and formulate a plan of attack on a project, you do your best work in isolation without interruption. You‚Äôre proactive in tackling things that need to be done without direction.You‚Äôre exceptional at communicating in writing via instant message, email, etc. You‚Äôre ok on the phone and video chat too. You understand that clear, concise written communication is how remote teams thrive. Putting a pull request up for review without explaining its context is unheard of for you. You own both successes and failures. When a project you‚Äôre leading turns into a disaster, you own it and you learn from it. You never point the finger at others.You invite criticism and genuinely want to grow as a professional. You‚Äôre onboard with pushing each other to be better and are not afraid to give constructive criticism in addition to receiving it. The Offer¬†Location Independent. Work from wherever you‚Äôre happiest, as long as you can make a scheduled meeting or two per week.Choose Your Schedule. Most companies claim to have flexible hours, but the reality is often very different. We flex our hours for real. üí™ As long as you‚Äôre working the number of hours you‚Äôve committed to working each week and you do what you say you‚Äôll do, we‚Äôre good.Company Retreats. As a remote company, it‚Äôs super important to get some face time. Last year we had a blast in Berlin but we had to cancel our trip to Portugal this past June. Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to meet up again soon. Will you be joining us?Personal Development. If there‚Äôs a conference or event that will help you level up, the company will cover your expenses. You‚Äôre also allotted 3 hours per month to learn something new, participate in community discussions, and/or contribute to an open source project.Profit Sharing. I present a Profit & Loss report to the team quarterly so everyone knows how the company is doing. And when the company does well, the team does well. Last year, a member of the team received on average USD $3,100.Company Holidays. Things get pretty quiet in late December / early January, so we always treat ourselves to a couple of weeks off to reboot during this time.Paid Leave. For the birth or adoption of a child, the company offers 8 weeks of 100% paid leave for primary caregivers and 3 weeks for secondary caregivers. We also offer 5 paid sick days and 3 days of paid bereavement leave.Health Insurance.

You don‚Äôt mind wearing multiple hats on any given day.You‚Äôre curious and love to learn. You embrace the opportunity to level up, learn something new and really dig into it. You‚Äôre a disciplined worker and have no trouble getting work done at home on any given day.You value consistency above preference and will adopt new coding styles, standards, and tools to that end. You are stellar at identifying the simple, elegant solution in a sea of over-engineering possibilities.Although you often need people to help you generate ideas and formulate a plan of attack on a project, you do your best work in isolation without interruption. You‚Äôre proactive in tackling things that need to be done without direction.You‚Äôre exceptional at communicating in writing via instant message, email, etc. You‚Äôre ok on the phone and video chat too.

Will you be joining us on future retreats?Personal Development. If there‚Äôs a conference or event that will help you level up, the company will cover your expenses. You‚Äôre also allotted 3 hours per month to learn something new, participate in community discussions, and/or contribute to an open source project.Profit Sharing. I present a Profit & Loss report to the team quarterly so everyone knows how the company is doing. And when the company does well, the team does well.Company Holidays. Things get pretty quiet in late December / early January, so we always treat ourselves to a couple of weeks off to reboot during this time.Paid Leave. For the birth or adoption of a child, the company offers 8 weeks of 100% paid leave for primary caregivers and 3 weeks for secondary caregivers. We also offer 5 paid sick days and 3 days of paid bereavement leave.Competitive Salaries. The company pays salaries that are competitive with the market in which you reside.

Implement a solution that will solve this problem and will allow to specify either since when you want to fetch tweets or between what timestamps and will deliver the result via the email. Divide the solution into two Rails applications:1.1 Service A with UI where specify the input (i.e. timestamps but also the email address, to which the results will be delivered)1.2 Service B will accept the input somehow from Service A and deliver the result via email. The template for the email should be customizable (e.g. using Liquid) and the Service B should be flexible enough to handle potentially other use cases with different input. In that sense, delivering URLs from Twitter would be just one of the many types of emails that such service should be capable of handling. The template for this particular use case should include the URLs themselves, date and some info indicating what it is about (especially for shortened URLs). Treat it as a real-world project and send us a link to the repo.Technical interview with a remote pair-programming session: the interview part shouldn't take too much time - we are mostly interested in the ability to solve the actual problems and being able to figure out the best possible solution for that problem, not in knowing things can be easily googled and learned through experience, that's why the interview part will be focused mostly on open-ended questions about some non-trivial matters.

Last month, our website received 1,098,625 unique visitors. And we already have 157,563 paying customers who take our online courses.Join our team, and your work will directly benefit all these people!5.Stability You Can Count OnMost startups have huge ambitions ‚Äì but little or no revenue.If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be.Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We‚Äôve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales.You won‚Äôt have to worry about our company running out of money.6.Perks That Make A DifferenceTo get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions.Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable.

When we build software, we take for granted the existence of collaborative tools to write and debug code. The machine learning workflow has no standard tooling for labeling data, storing it, debugging models and then continually improving model accuracy. Enter Labelbox. Labelbox's vision is to become the default software for data scientists to manage data and train neural networks in the same way that GitHub or text editors are defaults for software engineers.Current Labelbox customers include American Family Insurance, Lytx, Airbus, Genius Sports, Keeptruckin and more. Labelbox is venture backed by Google, Kleiner Perkins and First Round Capital and has been featured in Tech Crunch, Web Summit and Forbes.ResponsibilitiesStrong understanding of Javascript with an interest in using TypescriptExperience managing/scaling SQL databases, orchestrating migrations, and disaster recoveryExperience working with Redux and architecting large single page applicationsExperience and interest in frontend testingOptimizing data models and database configurations for both ease-of-use and performant response timesFollow-on ResponsibilitiesBuilding new features and resolvers in our GraphQL API with Node.JSExperience with SQL databasesExperience optimizing web trafficExperience with RabbitMQ (or other message broker) and RedisExperience constructing and monitoring ETL pipelinesExperience with Logstash / ElasticsearchFamiliarity with Kubernetes and DockerRequirements5+ years of experience building large-scale web applicationsA bachelor‚Äôs degree (or equivalent) in computer science or a related field.We believe that AI has the power to transform every aspect of our lives -- from healthcare to agriculture. The exponential impact of artificial intelligence will mean mammograms can happen quickly and cheaply irrespective of the limited number of radiologists there are in the world and growers will know the instant that disease hits their farm without even being there.At Labelbox, we‚Äôre building a platform to accelerate the development of this future. Rather than requiring companies to create their own expensive and incomplete homegrown tools, we‚Äôve created a training data platform that acts as a central hub for humans to interface with AI.
