I'm looking for someone to lead a junior developer that I've partnered with. The project is to continue developing DateSpot, the first marketplace connecting singles with matchmaking clients, across multiple companies. It's a unique dating site that's private, requires no messaging and allows human matchmakers to do the work in finding people love.
You would be an integral part of the company's vision and execution long-term. I'd like someone who wants to be part of the team, even if potentially and down the road, rather than someone at an agency who wants to stay there.
Tasks:
There are some high priority tasks that I'd like completed, and then potentially a complete refactor (there are currently two types of code). The roadmap includes mobile optimization, creating a CMS, new pages for referrals to other experts, and integrating data to apply filters that are game-changing in the industry. Down the road, I'd love to do AI integration and I'm totally open to ideas.
Requirements:

At least 1 year of professional coding experience out of school, and 3+ years preferred.
Intimate knowledge of Facebook React, Node/Express, and MongoDB.
Experience working in Digital Ocean
Knowledge of automated emails through SendGrid
Strategic thinking and you enjoy being asked a lot of questions about how we should do things on the site.
Comfortable with starting from other people's code, and in this case, different code styles across two different previous teams
Experience mentoring or teaching someone else in the coding space
Live in the U.S. (PST preferred)
You think that working in the dating industry would be fun!

Compensation:
DateSpot Inc. is a C-corp, so I'm open to you joining for full or partial equity. I'd like to do a test period with you as a contractor first to see how we work together as a team with the other developer - $500 initially, based on $50/hr. Past that point, we can talk about how we want to move forward - you alone, you with the current junior dev, or you with a different developer.
