I'm looking for someone to lead a junior developer that I've partnered with. The project is to continue developing DateSpot, the first marketplace connecting singles with matchmaking clients, across multiple companies. It's a unique dating site that's private, requires no messaging and allows human matchmakers to do the work in finding people love.
You would be an integral part of the company's vision and execution long-term. I'd like someone who wants to be part of the team, even if potentially and down the road, rather than someone at an agency who wants to stay there.
Tasks:
There are some high priority tasks that I'd like completed, and then potentially a complete refactor (there are currently two types of code). The roadmap includes mobile optimization, creating a CMS, new pages for referrals to other experts, and integrating data to apply filters that are game-changing in the industry. Down the road, I'd love to do AI integration and I'm totally open to ideas.
Requirements:

At least 1 year of professional coding experience out of school, and 3+ years preferred.
Intimate knowledge of Facebook React, Node/Express, and MongoDB.
Experience working in Digital Ocean
Knowledge of automated emails through SendGrid
Strategic thinking and you enjoy being asked a lot of questions about how we should do things on the site.
Comfortable with starting from other people's code, and in this case, different code styles across two different previous teams
Experience mentoring or teaching someone else in the coding space
Live in the U.S. (PST preferred)
You think that working in the dating industry would be fun!

Compensation:
DateSpot Inc. is a C-corp, so I'm open to you joining for full or partial equity. I'd like to do a test period with you as a contractor first to see how we work together as a team with the other developer - $500 initially, based on $50/hr. Past that point, we can talk about how we want to move forward - you alone, you with the current junior dev, or you with a different developer.
Let's do this and bring people love!

Hex is building a modern data analysis platform to empower data teams to have outsize impact within their organizations. With Hex, users can easily connect to data, build and collaborate on analyses, and turn their work into beautiful data-driven apps usable by everyone.
Our current team is focused primarily on engineering and design. We're all working remotely, plan to do so for the foreseeable future, and will always offer first-class support for remote team members.
We're backed by great VC funds and angels, so we're able to offer competitive salary and meaningful early-stage equity. We also offer unlimited PTO, flexible benefits, free lunch, and more.
Though we're small, we value building a thoughtful and intentional company culture. We prioritize autonomy, quality, feedback, and bias toward action. You might be a good fit to join us if you enjoy building thoughtful products, empowering users, and helping data teams do their best work.
About the role
The Product Expert is a critical role that will give you exposure to everything at Hex.
Our focus is on building a valuable product that users love, and all your work will feed into that. You will engage with our users, help them understand Hex, synthesize their feedback, and build the infrastructure to support our growing customer base.
You will also work closely with Engineering and Design to research, scope, and roll out new product features based on user needs and feedback.
Hex is an early-stage company, and the right person for this role should be able to thrive in an unstructured environment. You will be expected to self-direct, be comfortable navigating ambiguity, and drive the evolution of the scope and focus of your role over time.
In the near-term, expect a lot of hands-on, nitty-gritty work, often needing to flex in to other areas and wear new hats, including occasionally plugging in on Ops, Marketing, or Sales until we have dedicated people in those functions.
In the mid-to-long-term, expect an increasing amount of specialization into a deeper role, with a goal of eventually building and scaling a team.
Core responsibilities will include:

Working with users through the lifecycle from onboarding to implementation to day-to-day support, including serving as front-line for issues and ongoing engagement.
Translating user feedback and needs to well-scoped requirements, and working with Engineering and Design to deliver them in the platform.
Building infrastructure around user onboarding and support, such as our waitlist, support channels, and customer communications.
Tracking metrics and measurement on user engagement and behavior.
Crafting well-written user-facing communications and documentation.

About You

A demonstrated aptitude for partnering with internal or external stakeholders.
Excellent communication skills, both written and live, with an emphasis on clarity, concision, and candor.
A high rate of learning, natural curiosity, and eagerness to debate opinions to find truth.
A passion for team work, and willingness to be patient, provide honest feedback, and help us build an awesome company culture.

A 🦄 candidate will also have:
